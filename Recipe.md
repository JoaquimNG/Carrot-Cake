1 - Preheat the oven to 350˚F (180˚C). Grease 3 8-inch (20 cm) round cake pans and line with parchment paper.

2 - Grate the carrots on the small holes of a box grater. Set aside.

3 - In a large bowl, sift together 2½ cups (310 G) of flour, the cinnamon, allspice, salt, baking powder, and baking soda. Whisk together.

4 - In a separate large bowl, beat the brown sugar, granulated sugar, and eggs together with an electric hand mixer on medium speed until just combined.

5 - With the mixer running, gradually pour in the vegetable oil.

6 - With the mixer on medium-low speed, add ⅓ of the flour mixture at a time to the wet ingredients. Beat just to incorporate. Stop mixing when there is just a small amount of flour visible.

7 - In a small bowl, toss the raisins with the remaining tablespoon of flour.

8 - Add the raisin, grated carrots, and pineapple to the batter and fold to incorporate with a rubber spatula.

9 - Divide the cake batter evenly between the prepared pans and smooth the tops.

10 - Bake for 25-30 minutes, until a fork inserted in the center of a cake comes out clean.

11 - Cool the cakes on a wire rack until the pans are cool to the touch. Remove the cakes from the pans and let cool completely on the rack.

12 - Make the icing: In a large bowl, beat together the butter, cream cheese, and vanilla with an electric hand mixer on medium-low speed. Once combined, mix on medium-high speed for 30 seconds, until light and fluffy.

13 - Add the powdered sugar, ½ cup (60 G) at a time, beating on medium-low speed to incorporate each addition.

14 - Assemble the cake: Check to see if the top of each cake is flat. If not, use a serrated knife level off the cakes.

15 - Place 1 cake layer on a serving platter or cake stand. Spoon ¼ of the icing on top and spread in an even layer. Add another layer of cake and spread with another ¼ of the icing. Set the last cake layer on top with the bottom up to ensure a very flat surface. Spread the rest of the icing over the top and sides.

16 - Gently press the walnuts into the icing around the sides of the cake.

17 - Chill for 30-60 minutes to let the icing set, then slice and serve.

18 - Enjoy!
